Hi everyone this is the Social Math homepage.  There isn't much here
yet but there will be sometime soon.

### Manifesto

[Here](/manifesto/) is the manifesto (so far).  Withhold your
disbelief until you've actually seen examples of Social Math (coming
soon).

### What I did to set up this site

[Here](/technical/) is a technical description.

### Please contribute!

Issues and pull requests are welcome on the [github repository]({{site.github.repository_url}}).
