### Social Math Manifesto

Mathematics has had a great impact on the way I think.  Not just the
way I think about mathematics, but the way I think about everything.
The tools mathematicians use to think about mathematics transfer
beyond mathematics, and even beyond academia.  They are just good
tools for thinking about anything, and they definitely have relevance
to practical life.  The trouble is, most people don't know about them,
because the mathematics that is taught in
schools
[literally isn't mathematics](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf).
This _non-mathematics_ that most people are familiar with not only
isn't helpful for thinking, but it is actively unhelpful, because it
is centered around following orders and saying the things that
authorities want to hear.  This is the very opposite of the free
creative thinking that real mathematics brings.  Most people don't
even know that real mathematics exists, since the non-mathematics in
school calls itself "mathematics" and thus eclipses real mathematics.

So how can you learn real mathematics?  Start with the books in the bibliography ;;;;;;;;;;insert link

Anyway, as I asserted at the beginning, real mathematics helps you
think about everything, not just mathematics.  So then, we would
expect that people who go to college and graduate school for pure
mathematics and get years and years of training would come out and
help the rest of us think.  But they don't!  Sadly, the only thing
they apply all that training to is more mathematics.  It is completely
self-serving!

The isolation of mathematics from the rest of life is due to the
dysfunctional way that our culture treats mathematics.  As already
mentioned, school gives most of the population a warped image of what
mathematics actually is.  In this warped image, math is not about
creativity and understanding, but rather about memorization and
following directions.  People who get good at it are geniuses who just
think better than ordinary people: that way they can follow more
complicated directions and keep more things in their head at once.
For non-mathematicians, math is inaccessible and irrelevant to the
world.

Though mathematicians are saddened by the public's misperception of
mathematics, they are complicit in this misperception.  This is
because they write and speak in a highly cryptic style which only they
understand.  As long as they communicate this way, they have not the
means to disabuse the public of their confusion.  On the contrary,
anything they say reinforces the image of mathematics as cryptic
esoterica that only really smart people can understand.  The
dysfunctional communication style of mathematicians also alienates
newcomers and prevents mathematical culture from ever making it into
the general culture, which would be *amazing* if it happened.

As a consequence of all the obstacles to learning mathematics that our
society sets up, the only people who ever learn it are those who do
almost nothing else with their life.  Thus they become a much happier
version of MMORPG addicts, since they are living their whole life not
for the real world but for the mathematical world.  The reason they
are happier than MMORPG addicts is that the mathematical world is
fucking amazing and beautiful and there is much to see and do there.
But it still does not rival the real world as a place to spend one's
life.  It should be possible to be a mathematician, but live in the
real world.  The tools of thought that mathematicians have so
fastidiously developed over the millenia should not just be applied in
the world of mathematics.  They should be applied in the real world as
well.  To _only_ apply these tools to mathematics is completely
self-serving.  Of course these tools should be applied to mathematics
as well, because much of the power of mathematics stems from its
self-referentiality; mathematics has been applied to itself on so many
levels that it has gained great self-knowledge, like someone who not
only understands themself, but also understands how they understand
themself, and how they do that, etc.  But for true self-knowledge,
mathematics must step outside itself and see how it relates to the
real world, the social world.

Social Math is a proposal to do this.  In Social Math, mathematics
will be applied to the world that humans live in.  It will be
presented accessibly, and its relevance to the real world and everyday
life will be immediately apparent.
